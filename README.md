  TARGET:   ESP32
  VERSION:  0.01
  Date:     02-10-2020
  Last
  Update:   02-10-2020 V0.01
            Port from Atmega328 to ESP from version 1.13
            
  Achieved: 03-10-2020 Runnable version on ESP32 with Nextion HMI         
  Purpose:  Build an NMEA0183 wind display to replace the old Robertsen wind displays
            supporting following types of tasks:
            - Reading NMEA0183 v2.x data without,
            - Parse the for wind and course and send datat to display
            - Overcome the limitations of the Arduino Nanpo V3, which stalls after Â± 15 mintes
  
  NOTES:    
        1)  NMEA encoding conventions in short
            An NMEA sentence consists of a start delimiter, followed by a comma-separated sequence
            of fields, followed by the character '*' (ASCII 42), the checksum and an end-of-line marker.
            i.e. <start delimiter><field 0>,<field 1>,,,<field n>*<checksum><end-of-linemarker>
            The start delimiter is either $ or !. <field 0> contains the tag and the remaining fields
            the values. The tag is normaly a 5 character wide identifier where the 1st 2 characters
            identify the talker ID and the last 3 identify the sentence ID.
            Maximum sentence length, including the $ and <CR><LF> is 82 bytes.

        2)  Rx2(GPIO 16) and TX2(GPIO 17) are reserved for the display communication 115200Bd
            Digital GPIO 22 (and 23) are reserved for NMEA talker via
            SoftSerial on 4800 Bd
  
  Hardware setup:
  The ESP32 has 3 Rx/Tx ports and has to be set to Serial2 
  
  Wiring Diagram (for NMEA0183 to NMEA0183 device):
  ESP32      | NMEA device
     GPIO 22 |  RX +   
     GPIO 23 |  TX + 
  
  Set the pins to the correct one for your development shield or breakout board.
  This program uses these data lines to the Nextion 3,5" Enhanced LCD,
  pin usage as follow:
  Nextion           Rx     | Tx     | 5V        | GND
  ESP32             GPIO16 | GPIO17 | 3.3V      | GND
  NOTE: The above settings works with the USB power to the ESP32

  ! Remember to set the pins to suit your display module! and that the EPS32 GPIO
  ! pins run on 3.3V (and not 5V as the Arduino)

  Warning:
  -----------
  Do NOT use this compass in situations involving safety to life
  such as navigation at sea.  
        
  TO DO:    Implement 2-way communication so that incomming NMEA data can be relayed
            to other devices. An NMEA0183 network is typically a daisy chained network

  LIMITATIONS: 
            No relay of NMEA0183 data possible currently. So display needs to be
            implemented as the last node in the daisy chain.
